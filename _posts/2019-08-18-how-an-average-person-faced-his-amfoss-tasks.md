I would say that the tasks were crafted to pick the best (exactly why I couldn't finish them all :P).I learned how to approach new problems and languages and several ways to overcome errors. Since computer science is a rapidly updating field, these will help me very much in the long run.

### Pre Lab sessions

### [TASK-0](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-0)
I had to skip this task since I had Ubuntu installed in my laptop for a while now and experienced a few other distros..

### [TASK-1](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-1)
After reading the instructions the task was an absolute cakewalk

### [TASK-2](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-2)
This task was really challenging. I had previous experience in C++ as it was a part of my syllabus in high school. Since I was familiar with the syntax I chose to do it with C++. I successfully finished all the sub tasks.

### [TASK-9](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-9)
I picked a CSS code and added few CDNs to make this site. Since I was instructed to do it with jekyll, which I tried doing and got it working. Though I chose to go with this since it looked cooler than that;)

### [TASK-14](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-14)
I completed upto 13 levels in Bandit during my summer vacation as recommended by a senior from FOSS 

## During Lab sessions

### [TASK-7](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-7)
Though I installed rust before the lab sessions began, I was hesitant to proceed with it since it was a completely new language to me. I was adviced to read codes when approaching a new language by my group leader. So I followed that and I managed to finish this task

### [TASK-8](https://github.com/ashwinkey04/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-8)
After reading the instructions for this task, I was totally baffled, so I did not apporach it at all. A friend of mine told me about pytesseract and how simple it was to use it. After that, I again read codes based on that and got done with this task

## Blockers

I was not able to finish tasks 3,4,5,6. I did attempt all of them, but I started devoting more time to these only after the lab sessions. So due to shortage of time, I was unable to rectify the errors I faced. In task-3, I learnt CSS and XPath selectors to use in nokogiri. But I was unable to use them in Google. For task-4, I was not able to comprehend the code properly. I got my API keys for tasks 5 and 6 only by 18th August since they were difficult on the first sight and I kept them for later since I had other tasks.
