**Why must we choose you?**
I honestly love coding. Getting an idea and implementing it to action is probably the best form of satisfaction as far as I am concerned. Since the club has a lot of multifaceted people, I could help myself in learning and improving my knowledge. There are a lot of "off" things about me which I could probably overcome if I join amFOSS. I'm socially super awkward. Spending time with different people might help, I am super lazy and postpone important things without any reason, I am not physically active.. ask me to blame myself, the list is just endless, so I will stop here ;)

**How were you before joining and how are you now**
I was skeptical about moving into hostel for the first time, but I was totally fine since the day one. I never had any fixed goal, so there is nothing to change about it. Moving out, I think I am using my 'independence' individually and financially in a good manner. I am adjusting to things and adapting to the new environment pretty well.

**What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection process**
Though I am not clear about the entire process, looking into the tasks: as I have already mentioned in the parent readme file, they were really challenging. My suggestion would be that the selection process could include looking into the individual's previous knowledge and achievements as well and give tasks based on them too.

**What is your plan for the next 6 months?**
Get into some project and do something useful. Try to satisfy my dad's wish of minimum CGPA of 8.5

**How would you contribute back to the club?**
I will help out people who wish to learn what I know. I will help the club in taking the right members in the forthcoming years.
